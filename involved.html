        <h2>support</h2>
        <p>
          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very
          welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
          accessible to the whole community.<br />You can also support us by
          donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have
          some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let
          us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will be able
          to assist you.

        <h2>volunteer</h2>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
          displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes
          of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly
          lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
          for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.<br />You can help
          volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d
          like to find out more about how you can get involved.
